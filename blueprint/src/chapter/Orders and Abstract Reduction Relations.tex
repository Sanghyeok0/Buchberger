\section{Monomial Ideals and Dicksonâ€™s Lemma}
\begin{corollary}[Dickson's Lemma]\label{cor:Dickson}
    Every subset $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}^n$ has only finitely many minimal elements with respect to the componentwise partial order. 
    In particular, every monomial ideal in $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is finitely generated.
\end{corollary}
