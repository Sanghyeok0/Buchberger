This repository contains a Lean 4 formalization of **Buchberger's Algorithm** for computing **GrÃ¶bner bases** in polynomial rings. GrÃ¶bner bases, introduced by **Bruno Buchberger in 1965**, are a fundamental tool in computational algebra, providing a systematic way to solve polynomial systems.

This project is based on **Lean 4** and **Mathlib**, and aims to **rigorously formalize polynomial ideal theory**, closely following standard references such as *Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms* by **Cox, Little, and O'Shea** [1], as well as *GrÃ¶bner Bases* by **Becker and Weispfenning** [2].
